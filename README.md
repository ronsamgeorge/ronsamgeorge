### Hi there, I'm Ronald George ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring software engineer with 1 year of experience as a Cloud Engineer at AWS. I have expertise in the MERN stack, Postgres, AWS SERVERLESS Services and I'm always excited to learn new technologies.

I'm currently working on FullStack Web Projects and looking for opportunities to collaborate on interesting projects. If you have any project ideas or would like to chat, feel free to reach out to me.

Thanks for visiting my profile!
